This repository contains a simple VBScript function that demonstrates a common error when using the IsEmpty function. The function takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their difference. However, if either a or b is an empty array or object, the IsEmpty function will return false, causing the function to return an incorrect result. The solution shows how to correctly handle empty arrays and objects using the IsArray and IsObject functions.
